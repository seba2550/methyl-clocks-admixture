# methyl-clocks-admixture
This is a repository for storage of all scripts used in the analyses for Cruz-González et al., 2024 (Methylation Clocks Do Not Predict Age or Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Across Genetically Admixed Populations)

The code stored herein includes multiple R scripts, Python scripts, and Bash scripts used to analyze the methylation data from 621 MAGENTA study individuals (AD patients and nondemented controls). The R code can be run on a standard laptop/desktop (for transparency's sake, I used a M1 Max Macbook Pro), but the Python and Bash scripts should be run on a relatively powerful computing cluster, given that gnomAD with hundreds of millions of genetic variants are leveraged at multiple steps.
